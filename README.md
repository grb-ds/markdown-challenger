#### A funny story
To celebrate my 18th birthday, my friends organized a surprise party at my house and of course they couldn't miss the alcoholic drinks. The party got even hotter when my older sisters arrived and bought stronger drinks. That night was the first and last time (so far) that I got drunk like that, after so much dancing, singing, drinking, crying and vomiting I fell asleep hugging the toilet in the bathroom. My mum was very angry, so the next day I had to say that I didn't remember anything hehe! But I do remember. I'll never forget that day, it was incredible.

##### TL;DR
If I don't remember it didn't happen.
